# "Oh Buoy! Optimal Design of a Vibration Energy Harvester for Ocean Wave Power"

The files in this repository are related to my completed undergraduate thesis completed in the fourth year of my degrees. Uploaded to this small repository are my full thesis submission (see "Final Engineering Thesis.pdf") and the Simulink system used to model the internal circuitry of the solution (see "internal_system.slx").
